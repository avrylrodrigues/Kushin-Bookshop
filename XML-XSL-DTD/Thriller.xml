		<Title> The 6:20 Man </Title>
		<Summary> Every day without fail, Travis Devine puts on a cheap suit, grabs his faux-leather briefcase, and boards the
				6:20 commuter train to Manhattan, where he works as an entry-level analyst at the city’s most prestigious
				investment firm. In the mornings, he gazes out the train window at the lavish homes of the uberwealthy,
				dreaming about joining their ranks. In the evenings, he listens to the fiscal news on his phone, already
				preparing for the next grueling day in the cutthroat realm of finance. Then one morning Devine’s tedious
				routine is shattered by an anonymous email: She is dead. Sara Ewes, Devine’s coworker and former girlfriend,
				has been found hanging in a storage room of his office building—presumably a suicide, prompting the NYPD to
				come calling on him. If that wasn’t enough, Devine receives another ominous visit, a confrontation that
				threatens to dredge up grim secrets from his past in the Army unless he participates in a clandestine
				investigation into his firm. </Summary>

		<Title> Lakewood </Title>
		<Summary> When Lena Johnson’s beloved grandmother dies, and the full extent of the family debt is revealed, the black
				millennial drops out of college to support her family and takes a job in the mysterious and remote town of
				Lakewood, Michigan. On paper, her new job is too good to be true. High paying. No out of pocket medical expenses.
				A free place to live. All Lena has to do is participate in a secret program—and lie to her friends and family about
				the research being done in Lakewood. An eye drop that makes brown eyes blue, a medication that could be a cure for
				dementia, golden pills promised to make all bad thoughts go away. The discoveries made in Lakewood, Lena is told,
				will change the world—but the consequences for the subjects involved could be devastating. As the truths of the
				program reveal themselves, Lena learns how much she’s willing to sacrifice for the sake of her family. Provocative
				and thrilling, Lakewood is a breathtaking novel that takes an unflinching look at the moral dilemmas many
				working-class families face, and the horror that has been forced on black bodies in the name of science. </Summary>

		<Title> Bluebird, Bluebird </Title>
		<Summary> When it comes to law and order, East Texas plays by its own rules--a fact that Darren Mathews, a black Texas
				Ranger, knows all too well. Deeply ambivalent about growing up black in the lone star state, he was the first in
				his family to get as far away from Texas as he could. Until duty called him home. When his allegiance to his roots
				puts his job in jeopardy, he travels up Highway 59 to the small town of Lark, where two murders--a black lawyer
				from Chicago and a local white woman--have stirred up a hornet's nest of resentment. Darren must solve the
				crimes--and save himself in the process--before Lark's long-simmering racial fault lines erupt. </Summary>
